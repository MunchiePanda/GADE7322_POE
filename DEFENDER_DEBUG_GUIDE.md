# Defender Debug Logging Guide

## 🎯 **Comprehensive Debug System Added!**

Both Frost and Lightning defenders now have detailed debug logging to show exactly what they're doing.

## 🎮 **How to Use Debug Information**

### **Step 1: Open Console**
1. **Window → General → Console** in Unity
2. **Clear the console** to see fresh debug messages
3. **Play the scene** and watch the debug output

### **Step 2: Place Defenders**
1. **Place Frost and Lightning defenders** in the scene
2. **Watch for initial debug messages** when they spawn
3. **Check if they detect enemies** in range

### **Step 3: Observe Attack Behavior**
1. **Wait for enemies to come in range**
2. **Watch for targeting messages** - "Aiming at [EnemyName]"
3. **Watch for attack messages** - "ATTACKING! Target: [EnemyName]"
4. **Observe damage and effect messages** - "HIT [EnemyName] for X damage"

## 🔧 **Debug Message Examples**

### **Frost Tower Example:**
```
Frost Tower: Aiming at Enemy(Clone) (Distance: 6.2)
Frost Tower: ATTACKING! Target: Enemy(Clone), Cooldown: 3.1s
Frost Tower: Performing AoE attack with radius 8
Frost Tower: Found 3 colliders in range
Frost Tower: HIT Enemy(Clone) at distance 6.2 for 8 damage
Frost Tower: Applying slow effect to Enemy(Clone) for 3s
Frost Tower: Slowing Enemy(Clone) from 2.0 to 0.8 speed
Frost Tower: Attack complete! Hit 1 enemies
```

### **Lightning Tower Example:**
```
Lightning Tower: Aiming at Enemy(Clone) (Distance: 5.8)
Lightning Tower: ATTACKING! Target: Enemy(Clone), Cooldown: 1.3s
Lightning Tower: Starting chain lightning attack (Max targets: 3)
Lightning Tower: Chain 1 - HIT Enemy(Clone) at distance 5.8 for 15.0 damage
Lightning Tower: Searching for chain targets around Enemy(Clone) (Range: 4, Found: 2 colliders)
Lightning Tower: Found potential target Enemy2(Clone) at distance 3.2
Lightning Tower: Selected next target: Enemy2(Clone) at distance 3.2
Lightning Tower: Chain 1 -> 2: Jumping to Enemy2(Clone) at distance 3.2
Lightning Tower: Chain 2 - HIT Enemy2(Clone) at distance 3.2 for 12.0 damage
Lightning Tower: Chain attack complete! Hit 2 enemies
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting with Debugs**

### **If Defenders Don't Attack:**
1. **Check for "No target in range"** - Enemies might be too far
2. **Check for "On cooldown"** - Wait for cooldown to finish
3. **Check for "Aiming at"** - Defenders should show targeting

### **If Attacks Don't Hit:**
1. **Check "Found X colliders in range"** - Should be > 0
2. **Check "HIT [EnemyName]"** - Should show damage dealt
3. **Check enemy health** - Enemies should take damage

### **If Chain Lightning Stops:**
1. **Check "No more targets in range"** - Chain range might be too small
2. **Check "No valid chain targets found"** - No enemies in chain range
3. **Check chain range settings** - Should be 4 units by default

## 📊 **Debug Performance**

- ✅ **Detailed logging** - Shows every step of the process
- ✅ **Distance calculations** - Shows exact ranges and distances
- ✅ **Damage tracking** - Shows damage dealt to each enemy
- ✅ **Effect tracking** - Shows slow effects and chain jumps
- ✅ **Timing information** - Shows cooldowns and attack intervals

## 🎯 **Expected Debug Flow**

### **Normal Attack Sequence:**
1. **"Aiming at [EnemyName]"** - Defender acquires target
2. **"ATTACKING! Target: [EnemyName]"** - Attack begins
3. **"HIT [EnemyName] for X damage"** - Damage dealt
4. **"Attack complete! Hit X enemies"** - Attack finished
5. **"On cooldown (X.Xs / Y.Ys)"** - Cooldown period

Your defenders now provide **complete visibility** into their behavior and attack patterns!
