# GADE7322 – Tower Defence Game (Portfolio of Evidence)

## Project Overview
This project is the Portfolio of Evidence (PoE) for **Game Development 3B (GADE7322)**. The objective is to develop a **tower defence game** incorporating **procedural generation**. The game centers around a **Central Tower** (player base) that enemies attack endlessly via predefined paths. Players place defenders to protect the tower, with the game ending when the tower is destroyed. Procedural generation must be implemented in **terrain**, **enemy waves**, and a **custom feature**.

### Submission Structure & Weighting
- **Part 1**: Procedural Terrain & Base Mechanics – 25%
- **Part 2**: Procedural Enemy Waves – 30%
- **Part 3**: Upgrades, Shaders, Custom Procedural Feature – 35%
- **ICE**: In-Class Evaluation – 10%

**Submission Requirements** (for each part):
- **GitHub Repository**: Share the repo link with the lecturer added as a collaborator.
- **Presentation Video**: 5–6 minute video showcasing progress and explaining code.

## Part 1 – Procedural Terrain & Base Mechanics (100 Marks)

### Requirements
1. **Procedural Terrain & Tower** (20 Marks)
   - Generate a unique 3D mesh at runtime for each game session.
   - Include ≥3 distinct pathways leading to the central tower.
   - Central tower must have health and auto-attack enemies.

2. **Defenders** (20 Marks)
   - Allow placement of defenders at designated terrain locations (excluding paths).
   - Defenders auto-attack enemies, have health, and can be destroyed.

3. **Enemies** (20 Marks)
   - Enemies spawn at terrain-based spawn points at regular intervals.
   - Enemies follow paths, attack the tower and defenders, have health, and can be destroyed.

4. **Game Loop** (10 Marks)
   - Implement a balanced resource system for placing defenders.
   - Game ends when the tower’s health reaches zero.

5. **UI/UX** (10 Marks)
   - Display tower health, resources, and defender costs.
   - Provide visual feedback for damage and hits.
   - Include pause and restart options.

6. **Complexity** (10 Marks)
   - Ensure appropriate difficulty and originality in design.

7. **Presentation Video** (10 Marks)
   - Submit a 5–6 minute video explaining code and demonstrating progress.

### Requirements
1. **Two New Enemy Types** (20 Marks)
   - Introduce two unique enemy types with distinct behaviors and visuals.

2. **Two New Defender Types** (20 Marks)
   - Introduce two unique defender types with distinct behaviors and visuals.

3. **Planning: Procedural Enemy Waves** (20 Marks)
   - Submit a 400–500 word document with diagrams.
   - Detail difficulty scaling, adaptation to player skill/playstyle, and spawn logic.

4. **Implementation** (20 Marks)
   - Implement adaptive enemy wave spawning as outlined in the planning document.

5. **Complexity** (10 Marks)
   - Ensure procedural waves are appropriately complex and innovative.

6. **Presentation Video** (10 Marks)
   - Submit a 5–6 minute video explaining code and demonstrating progress.

## Part 3 – Upgrades, Shaders, Custom Procedural Feature (100 Marks)

### Requirements
1. **Upgrades** (20 Marks)
   - Implement ≥2 upgrades for defenders and the tower.
   - Upgrades must enhance health/stats and include visual changes.
   - Ensure balance with enemy waves.

2. **Shaders** (10 Marks)
   - Implement ≥1 vertex displacement shader.
   - Implement ≥1 base color modification shader.

3. **Visual Effects** (10 Marks)
   - Create ≥1 custom particle system.
   - Create ≥1 custom post-processing effect.

4. **Planning: Custom Procedural Feature** (20 Marks)
   - Submit a 400–500 word document with diagrams.
   - Examples: procedural soundtrack, narrative, or enemy generation.

5. **Implementation: Custom Feature** (20 Marks)
   - Implement the custom procedural feature as outlined in the planning document.

6. **Complexity** (10 Marks)
   - Ensure the custom feature is appropriately complex and innovative.

7. **Presentation Video** (10 Marks)
   - Submit a 5–6 minute video explaining code and demonstrating progress.
