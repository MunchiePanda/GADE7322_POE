# Adaptive Enemy Scaling System Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

The Adaptive Enemy Scaling System dynamically adjusts enemy difficulty based on player performance, creating a balanced and engaging experience that adapts to the player's skill level.

## 🚀 **What It Does**

### **Adaptive Enemy Count**
- **High Performance**: Spawns MORE enemies (up to 3x more)
- **Low Performance**: Spawns FEWER enemies (down to 0.3x)
- **Real-time adjustment** based on current wave performance

### **Adaptive Enemy Power**
- **High Performance**: Stronger enemies (higher health, speed, damage)
- **Low Performance**: Weaker enemies (lower stats)
- **Dynamic scaling** that combines wave progression + performance

### **Strategic Enemy Placement**
- **Armored Dragons First**: When player doing well, spawns tanks first
- **Adaptive Bomber Frequency**: More bombers when player has many defenders
- **Faster Bombers**: Increased speed for high-performing players

### **Performance Tracking**
- **Tower Health**: Monitors tower damage taken
- **Kill Efficiency**: Tracks enemies killed vs reached tower
- **Wave Speed**: Measures how quickly waves are completed
- **Resource Efficiency**: Tracks resource gains vs spending
- **Defender Losses**: Monitors defenders destroyed

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Automatic Setup**
The system is **automatically configured** when you start the game:

1. **PlayerPerformanceTracker** is automatically added to GameManager
2. **EnemySpawner** is automatically connected to the performance tracker
3. **All systems** are initialized and ready to use

### **Step 2: Manual Configuration (Optional)**
If you want to customize the adaptive scaling:

1. **Select GameManager** in the scene
2. **Find "Performance Tracker"** in the Inspector
3. **Adjust settings** as needed:
   - **Performance Weights**: How much each metric affects difficulty
   - **Debug Info**: Enable to see performance calculations in console

### **Step 3: EnemySpawner Configuration**
1. **Select the GameManager** (which has EnemySpawner component)
2. **Find "Adaptive Scaling"** section in Inspector
3. **Adjust parameters**:
   - **Performance Count Multiplier**: How much performance affects enemy count (0.5 = 50% influence)
   - **Max/Min Enemy Count Multiplier**: Limits for enemy count scaling
   - **Performance Power Multiplier**: How much performance affects enemy stats
   - **Bomber Settings**: Base and max bomber spawn chances

## 📊 **How It Works**

### **Performance Score Calculation (0-100)**
```
Performance Score = Tower Health Score + Kill Efficiency Score + 
                   Wave Speed Score + Resource Efficiency Score + 
                   Defender Loss Score
```

### **Adaptive Scaling Examples**

#### **When Player is Doing Well (Score > 70):**
- ✅ **More enemies**: 1.5x to 3x more enemies per wave
- ✅ **Stronger enemies**: 1.2x to 2.5x health, speed, damage
- ✅ **More bombers**: Up to 4x more frequent
- ✅ **Faster bombers**: Up to 1.5x speed
- ✅ **Armored dragons first**: 30% chance to spawn tanks first

#### **When Player is Struggling (Score < 30):**
- ✅ **Fewer enemies**: 0.3x to 0.7x fewer enemies per wave
- ✅ **Weaker enemies**: 0.4x to 0.8x health, speed, damage
- ✅ **Fewer bombers**: Base frequency only
- ✅ **Normal bomber speed**: No speed boost
- ✅ **Only basic enemies**: No armored dragons

#### **When Player is Neutral (Score 30-70):**
- ✅ **Normal scaling**: Standard wave-based progression
- ✅ **Balanced difficulty**: Neither too easy nor too hard

## 🎮 **Expected Behavior**

### **Console Output Examples:**
```
Performance Tracker: Wave started. Tower Health: 95.2%
Performance Tracker: Enemy killed. Total: 3
Adaptive Enemy Count: Base=7.5, Performance=78.3, Multiplier=1.64, Final=12
Adaptive Scaling: Spawning Armored Dragon as tank for high-performing player!
Adaptive Scaling: Health=120.5 (x1.23), Speed=3.2 (x1.15), Damage=8.5 (x1.20)
Performance Tracker: Wave completed in 28.4s. Performance Score: 82.1
```

### **Visual Indicators:**
- **Debug Console**: Shows performance calculations and adaptive scaling
- **Enemy Count**: Noticeably more/fewer enemies based on performance
- **Enemy Strength**: Enemies become stronger/weaker based on performance
- **Bomber Frequency**: More bombers when player has many defenders

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **No Adaptive Scaling:**
- Check console for "No PlayerPerformanceTracker found!" warning
- Ensure GameManager has the performance tracker component
- Verify EnemySpawner is connected to the performance tracker
- **Fixed**: All compilation errors have been resolved
- **Fixed**: Tower health access methods updated
- **Fixed**: Enemy attackDamage access methods added

### **Too Easy/Hard:**
- Adjust **Performance Count Multiplier** (lower = less influence)
- Adjust **Performance Power Multiplier** (lower = less stat scaling)
- Modify **Max/Min multipliers** to set difficulty limits

### **No Debug Info:**
- Enable **"Show Debug Info"** in PlayerPerformanceTracker
- Check console for performance calculations
- Look for "Adaptive Scaling" messages

## 📈 **Performance Metrics**

### **Tower Health Score (0-30 points):**
- **100% health**: 30 points
- **50% health**: 15 points
- **0% health**: 0 points

### **Kill Efficiency Score (0-25 points):**
- **100% kills**: 25 points
- **50% kills**: 12.5 points
- **0% kills**: 0 points

### **Wave Speed Score (0-20 points):**
- **Fast completion**: 20 points
- **Normal completion**: 10 points
- **Slow completion**: 5 points

### **Resource Efficiency Score (0-15 points):**
- **High efficiency**: 15 points
- **Balanced efficiency**: 7.5 points
- **Low efficiency**: 3 points

### **Defender Loss Score (0-10 points):**
- **No losses**: 10 points
- **Few losses**: 7.5 points
- **Many losses**: 2.5 points

## 🎯 **Grade Impact**

This system adds:
